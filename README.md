# Custom Thread Pool Executor Implementation

A custom implementation of a Thread Pool Executor inspired by Java's ExecutorService, demonstrating core concepts of concurrent programming and thread management.

## Overview

This project implements a custom thread pool executor that manages a pool of worker threads to execute submitted tasks. It provides a practical example of how thread pools work and implements core concurrency patterns.

## Key Features

- Fixed-size thread pool
- Non-blocking task submission
- Thread-safe task queue management
- Graceful shutdown mechanism
- Task execution with error handling

## Components

### 1. Task Interface
```java
public interface Task {
    void execute();
}
```
Defines the contract for executable tasks.

### 2. Executor Service
```java
public class ExeService {
    // Manages thread pool and task execution
}
```
Main class that:
- Initializes thread pool
- Handles task submission
- Manages thread lifecycle
- Provides shutdown capabilities

### 3. Runnable Task
```java
public class RunnableTask implements Runnable {
    // Worker thread implementation
}
```
Worker thread implementation that:
- Continuously polls for tasks
- Executes tasks from queue
- Handles thread interruption
- Supports graceful shutdown

## Implementation Details

### Thread Pool Management
- Fixed number of threads created at initialization
- Threads are reused for multiple tasks
- Idle threads wait efficiently using wait/notify mechanism

### Task Queue
- Uses `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` for thread-safe operations
- Non-blocking task submission
- Efficient task distribution among threads

### Synchronization
- Thread-safe task queue operations
- Proper handling of thread interruption
- Volatile flags for shutdown coordination

### Error Handling
- Task execution within try-catch blocks
- Proper thread interruption handling
- Exception propagation management

## Usage Example

```java
// Create executor service with 4 threads
ExeService executor = new ExeService(4);

// Submit task
executor.execute(() -> {
    // Task implementation
    System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
});

// Shutdown executor
executor.stopExecuter();
```

## Technical Considerations

### Thread Safety
- All queue operations are thread-safe
- Proper synchronization for task submission and execution
- Volatile boolean flags for shutdown coordination

### Performance
- Non-blocking task submission
- Efficient task queuing
- Minimal contention points

### Resource Management
- Controlled thread creation
- Proper thread cleanup on shutdown
- Memory-efficient task handling

## Limitations and Future Improvements

1. Current Limitations
   - Fixed thread pool size
   - Basic error handling
   - Simple shutdown mechanism

2. Potential Improvements
   - Dynamic thread pool sizing
   - Task prioritization
   - Enhanced error handling and recovery
   - Task completion callbacks
   - Thread pool metrics and monitoring
   - Task cancellation support
   - Task timeout implementation

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Basic understanding of concurrent programming

## Best Practices

1. Task Submission
   - Keep tasks small and focused
   - Avoid blocking operations in tasks
   - Handle exceptions within tasks

2. Thread Pool Sizing
   - Consider CPU cores and workload
   - Account for I/O-bound vs CPU-bound tasks
   - Monitor thread utilization

3. Shutdown
   - Always call shutdown when done
   - Allow time for task completion
   - Handle interrupted exceptions
